# Data-Mining-top-K

- Implemented a carefully optimized program in Java to extract top-K and crossed top-K records from ~50 GB data and tens of millions of logs and users. 
- Explored storing tens of millions of items in the memory of a single computer and fast search by pushing the limit of data structures and algorithms.
- See the quick-report.pdf for a more detailed report of the program design and performance of data structures and algorithms.
